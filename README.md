# Poco F1 vendor and firmware extraction script

https://t.me/pocovendor

This is just a personal automation script and doesn't feature much error handling, informative error messages or even code comments, excuse me for that. It's dead simple and self explanatory.

#### Usage
`./extract.sh <miui_beryllium_rom_zip>`

Most operations are verbose and you will get an idea what's happening at every step. It doesn't cleans the intermediate files/directories it makes on purpose.

This script is provided 'AS IS' without any guarantee whatsoever.
